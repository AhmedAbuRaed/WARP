# Basic configuration instructions for warp_text.
# These instructions are for basic project configuration.
# Before reading this, make sure that all packages are installed and that apache
# and mysql are properly configured.
# The instructions for that are in doc/INSTALLATION.txt 

1. Loging for the first time

The default installation of warp_text comes with a pre-set admin user. The
credentials for it are warp_admin / warp_text
Please make sure to change the password as soon as you log in.

The admin interface has three different panels - dataset, users, and layers.


2. User management

- In the user management section of the interface you can add, modify and delete
  users on the system.

- When creating or modifying an user, the following options have to be set:
	- username (unique)

	- password

	- collaboration mode - you can configure multiple users to collaborate
	  together. That is, the users will be assigned the same pairs to
	  annotate and will be able to see each others' annotation. Unless you
	  know what you are doing and you REALLY need this feature, it is highly
	  recommended to leave this option to "Independent".

	- admin - admin users have access to the admin panel. non-admin users
	  have access to the annotator panel. Admin users can't annotate.

	- disabled - disabled users will NOT be able to log in the system.
	  However all existing annotations are kept in the system and can be
	  exported when "export" function is used. The users ca be re-enabled at
	  a later point.

- When deleting a user, ALL data associated with that user (including
  annotations) will be PERMANENTLY deleted. This action is irreversible, so
  proceed carefully

- Make sure to change the default admin password


3. Layer management

- In the layer management section of the interface, you can add, modify,
  reorder, and delete layers. At each layer you can confgure relations.

- When creating or modifying a layer, the following options have to be set:
	- Layer name (unique)

	- Layer type - currently there are only two layer types: ``textual'' and
	  ``atomic''. ``Textual'' annotates relations that affect the whole
	  text. ``Atomic'' annotates relations that have more fine-grained
	  scope.

	- Text separator - the system automatically splits the text to ``elements''
	  that can be selected and annotated. The text is split by specified
	  separator. If no text separator is specified, the system assumes the 
	  text separator to be whitespace. Each token will be a ``unit''. If a
	  custom separation is needed (ex.: phrases, sentences, paragraphs) the
	  corpus needs to be pre-processed prior to insertion in warp-text. Each
	  of the ``elements'' has to be separated by the specified separator (for
	  example EOS). 
	  N.B.: Text separators configured by any layer are considered "special"
	  strings and are ignored at annotation time (i.e. annotators will NOT
	  see them and will NOT be able to annotate them). Make sure to use
	  separator strings that would not appear naturally in the text.

	- Sentence lock - by default, annotators are able to slect ``elements''
	  from both sentences. You can restrict them to only be able to select
	  from one while the other is displayed just for information.

	- Show previous layers - if this option is enabled, the annotation at
	  previous layers will be displayed.
	  N.B.: At the current version, only the annotation at previous layers
	  of type ``textual'' will be displayed.

	- disabled - if a layer is disabled, it will not appear during the
	  annotation process. However all relations and annotation already
	  performed at that layer are kept and will be exported.

- When configuring relations at each layer  (configure), the following options
  have to be set:

	For textual layer:
	- Option - the name of the relation OR the option
	- Short name - short name (for display purposes)
	- Relation - the relation that this option is assigned to
	i.e.: to have a relation "Textual Entailment" with options "Entailment",
	"Contradiction", and "Unknown", the following has to be configured:
	  - Textual Entailment (relation - relation)
	  - Entailment (relation - Textual Entailment)
	  - Contradiction (relation - Textual Entailment)
	  - Unknown (relation - Textual Entailment)

	For atomic layer:
	- Relation - the name of the relation (or meta-relation)
	- Short name - short name (for display purposes)
	- Meta relation - the category of the relation (i.e. lexical
	  substitution can belong to ``lexical'' category).
	- Key - Normally, annotators can annotate only one set of ``elements''
	  from each text. If key = 1, they can annotate two. (i.e. they can
	  annotate the whole portion of the text affected by ``Discourse
	  change'' and then separately annotate the specific tokens that are
	  changed.

- When deleting a layer, ALL data associated with that layer (including
  annotations and relations) will be PERMANENTLY deleted. This action is 
  irreversible, so proceed carefully


4. Dataset management

- In the dataset management you can see statistics of the annotation, assign
  pairs to users, import raw corpus for annotation and export the results of the
  annotation.

- The main dataset page (opened also when log in) shows overall statistics for
  the interface (number of pairs, users, annotations).

- Annotation statistics show more detailed statistics for the annotation
  process: number (and ids) of pairs assigned to each user, number (and ids) of
  the already annotated pairs

- Pair assignment displays all ranges of pairs currently assigned to all
  non-admin users (admin users can't be assigned pairs) and allows to assign or
  de-assign pairs.
	- To assign or de-assign a range of pairs, specify the first pair id,
	  the last pair id, and the action (assign or de-assign)
	- N.B.: pairs are assigned to users. If two or more users are in
	  colaborative mode, the pool of assigned pairs for the collaborating
	  group is the union of all pairs.
	- De-assigning pairs from a user also removes ALL annotation performed
	  on these pairs.
	- Removing a user from a collaboration group does NOT remove the
	  annotation performed by that user while part of the group.

- Importing a corpus expects a tab separated csv file
	- The file must have 7 fields: label, text1_id, text2_id, text_1,
	  text_2, description_1, description_2;
	- The content of the file will be automatically appended to the dataset
	  table.
	- Make sure your file is in UTF8 format !
